<p id="qs"> Qs: How and why do you associate with Entrepreneurship? </p>
<p id="ans"> Ans: I find entrepreneurship to be very exciting as being the son of an entrepreneur I have witnessed first-hand the many benefits of being one. Ever since I've read Rich Dad Poor Dad, the concept of 'working for your own' has taken hold of me. Not only the material benefits but also the satisfaction of creating new ideas and giving them flame is very appealing!</p>
